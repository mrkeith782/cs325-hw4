Included in the assignment is a Makefile that will compile the following programs:
./badsort


To execute the Makefile, use the command `make badsort` in your terminal. This will create the above executables that you can use. The executables will pull from the data.txt file 
and write out to a bad.out file.

Thanks, feel free to message me at my ONID with any questions.
