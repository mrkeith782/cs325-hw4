Included in the assignment is a Makefile that will compile the following programs:
./knapsack.exe

To execute the above assignment, make sure that data.txt is formatted. The included one will work just fine, but if you edit it, 
no guarentees! (you can edit the values, which are the second digits without it blowing up)

To make the assignment, move the assignment into FLIP and use the 'make' or 'make knapsack' command in your terminal. 
This will create ./knapsack.exe, which can be executed to run off data.txt.

If you have any questions, feel free to message me!
Thanks!
